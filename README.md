# UI-UX
Portfolio of User Interfaces &amp; User Experience Design Work

Here are the process I undertook when designing UI for InfoVisuGen webapp, a University research project in [Infographic Generation from Text](https://github.com/xx-m-h-u-xx/Generating-Infographics-from-Text/tree/main/Documentation/Design)

The `Design` repository includes:
  * `Brainstorming & Sketching` - transformed ideas into reality using pen & paper
  * `User Flow Diagram` - depicts the logic of the product, showing every possible interaction with UI
  * `User Story Mapping` - the roadmap of user stories, user journeys (steps a user takes to perform actions in the system) including other backlog items
  * `Style of Interface` - focuses on visual design (as well as additionally including service design)
  * `Wireframes` - low-detailed presentation of structure/description of user interaction with interface
  * `Mockups` - static representation of design
  * `Fidelity CLicable Prototypes` - highly-detailed representation of ideas turned into artifacts, simulating user interaction with interface
  * `Animated UI Flow` - video recorded simulation of the user interaction with app
